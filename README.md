# PyInterpret

This is an interpreter made in python lang.

To run this lang in your local device,

Clone this repo and open the repo in your terminal.

Then run python shell.py.

Some code snippets showing the lang features and its syntax:

```make a=2
   make b=2
   make c=a+b

   if a>=b do make b=a+b

   while c>=a do make c=c-1

   if a>=b and c>=a do make c=c+1

```


In future  I will be adding following features:

      1.print like statement
      2.string operations
      3.For loop
      4.function creation
      5.array 
      6.vectors
      7.sets
      8.map
